## Synth Waveform Analysis on Parameterized Oscillators and White Noise

Here are code written to perform **fourier analysis** on:
+ basic waveforms (sine, triangle, square, sawtooth)
+ some parameterized oscillators that are more sophisticated
+ parameterized white noise generator

as well as their outputs.
